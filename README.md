# Shadcn React Vite Starter

This project is a starter template for building React applications using Vite and Shadcn UI components. It provides a solid foundation for quickly developing modern, responsive web applications.


> Do you like IntelliSense for path aliases with Tailwind? This project does it brilliantly and supports Windows, Mac, and Linux! As the creator, I've tried many other starters and even the official Shadcn installation guide for Vite, but none of them provided proper IntelliSense for path aliases. This project, however, does it flawlessly. I'm not entirely sure why it works, but it does!

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
